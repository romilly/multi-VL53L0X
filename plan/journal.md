# Project journal for multi-VL53L0X

I'm experimenting to see how easy it is to connect multiple VL53L0X sensors to a Pi, Nano or Adafruit feather.

I have two approaches in mind:

1. Use an Arduino slave that selectively enables the chips and gives each a unique I2C address
1. Use an I2C multiplexer
